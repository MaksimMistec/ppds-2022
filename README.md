# PPDS 2022 - Lab exercises 7

In this exercise we try to implement 2 coprograms example using a scheduler.

## Contents
- 07.py

## Programs
1. subtract - function that takes 2 arguments (start and finish), subtracts random number from 1-5 from the starting number, until it reaches the finish number
2. even_number - function that waits for subtract to send the current total value (value after subtracting)

## Scheduler
Scheduler creates a list that serves as a queue when it's initiated. By calling schedule we add the task to the queue. Tasks will be executed in this order, and will run until they reach an exception.
